# Inheriting from built-in containers in Python: Creating a bi-directionl mapping

When inheriting from built-in classes like `dict` or `list`, one would expect that methods like `pop` or `get` would use `__delitem__`,  or that methods like `setdefault` or `update` or `__init__` would call `__setitem__` under the hood, but that isn't the case.  
The reason is that a lot of the code for these methods is in-lined, that is the same code is copy-pasted for each method for performance reasons (to avoid the overhead of function calls).  
So inheriting from built-in containers directly would require a lot of code since you have to redifine a lot of methods. Other alternatives, depending on your needs and how much customization you want, are using: `collections.UserDict` or `collections.abc.MutableMapping`.
